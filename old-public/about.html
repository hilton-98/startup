                        Applying to graduate school can be a pain. Every school wants different essays written, has different 
                        interview processes, and different deadlines for everything they want submitted! If you are only 
                        applying to one school then tracking that school's requirements might not bother you, but add a few 
                        more schools and it quickly becomes a headache! <span class="app-title">Runway</span> provides a 
                        central location for storing all the information about the application deadlines and requirements 
                        for graduate school applications.
